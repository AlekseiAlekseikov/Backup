/// The vehicle drawing a [TiltGauge] stands on its ground line.
///
/// One gauge serves both tilt axes, and the axis is carried entirely by this
/// value: pitch is the side view, roll is the front view. Nothing else in the
/// component knows which reading it is showing.
///
/// [aspectRatio] must be the asset's own ratio. The gauge sizes the drawing
/// from the dial and would distort it otherwise.
///
/// Every view is drawn to the same **height**, and the width follows from the
/// ratio. This is the one scale that is true: the views are the same vehicle,
/// so its height is the same in all of them, while a side view is over twice
/// as long as a front view is wide. Sizing by width instead makes the front
/// view tower over the side view at the same nominal size, and the two tiles
/// then read as two different cars.
///
/// Assets are ink in the alpha channel over black RGB, produced by
/// `scripts/extract_line_art.py` and then `scripts/thicken_line_art.py` from
/// the masters in `art/`. The gauge tints them with the theme ink through
/// [BlendMode.srcIn], so the colour planes are never shown and the art follows
/// the theme instead of shipping a second dark-mode copy.
///
/// The line weight is chosen for the size the gauge draws at, not for the
/// master. A line thin enough to fall below one pixel does not thin out — it
/// goes translucent, because the line is alpha — and the vehicle then reads as
/// a grey ghost beside the solid ground line. Re-run the thickening script if
/// this component starts drawing at a very different size.
