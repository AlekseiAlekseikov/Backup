/**
 * Opens this app on one tab, in place of a factory screen it suppresses.
 *
 * Two of these exist, one per suppressed screen: the charge plug, wired in
 * `TelemetryGraph`, and a projected phone, wired in
 * [ProjectionAutoOpenSupervisor]. They share this class because they share
 * every rule about **taking the display**, which is the part that can annoy a
 * driver. What they do not share is how the car is read, and neither of them
 * reads it here: each is told by the object that already holds the state
 * machine for its own signal.
 *
 * The charging half learned that the hard way. Its first version subscribed to
 * `0x24130200` on its own `CarPropertyManager` and never fired. Two reasons,
 * and either one alone was enough: that id is an **ECARX logical id**, which
 * `CarPropertyManager` cannot resolve — the VHAL property is
 * `GeelyProperties.ChargingPlugState` (`557871753`) — and the `Car.createCar`
 * overload it used to connect does not exist on this Android 9 head unit.
